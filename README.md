Awareness
=========

Awareness helps you become more aware of how much time you spend on the computer by playing soothing chimes to mark every hour of continuous computer use. For example, if you use your computer for three hours without a break, you will hear one chime after the first hour, two chimes after the second hour, and three chimes after the third hour.

Awareness displays how long you've been using your computer without a break in the menu bar. Awareness can sense when you take a break, so simply take a five minute break to reset the clock and silence the chimes.
